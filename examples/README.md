# Examples

This folder contains GNU Radio Companion (GRC) flowgraphs that showcase BLE and IEEE 802.15.4 decoders in action, along with a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) block that operates on the IQ data of overlapping signals.

The examples use pre-recorded BLE and IEEE 802.15.4 packets captured with a Pluto SDR from a Nordic Semiconductor nRF board.
The flowgraphs are intended for offline analysis but can be adapted for live reception using a Pluto SDR.
